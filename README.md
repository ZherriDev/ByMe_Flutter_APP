## ‚Ñπ About the Project

This project was developed during our internship at the company ByMe - Information Technology, Lda. based in Porto, Portugal.

This was our first experience having contact with slightly more complex projects like this. This Flutter App is just the front-end of the project, 
the back-end is found in this organization's repository:
[ByMe_Flask RESTful API](https://github.com/byme-internship-project/ByMe_Flask_RESTful_API)

The objective is to assist the work of doctors, allowing them to manage their patients and appointments. The application offers an intuitive interface and features that make the professional's day-to-day life easier, optimizing their time and improving the quality of service.
